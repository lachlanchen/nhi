This directory holds generated figure assets produced by the publication scripts.

Git intentionally ignores the contents here to avoid bloating the repository and
to keep resets/checkout operations clean. Re-generate figures locally via the
documented commands in `publication/FIGURE_SOURCES.md`.

If you need to persist a particular asset for discussion or archival, place it
outside this directory (e.g., under `publication/self_calibrated_event_spectrum/figures/`).
