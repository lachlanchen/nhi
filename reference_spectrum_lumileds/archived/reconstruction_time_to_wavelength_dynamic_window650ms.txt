Dynamic sliding-window reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 1.186660
Window width (ms): 650.000
Reconstruction start (ms): 349.538
Reconstruction end (ms): 852.147
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 0.609120 * t_ms + 204.126
Where t_ms is the compensated event timeline measured from the first sample.
