Compensated reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 1.256329
Reconstruction start (ms): 368.820
Reconstruction end (ms): 865.360
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 0.616565 * t_ms + 189.634
Where t_ms is compensated time measured relative to the earliest bin.
