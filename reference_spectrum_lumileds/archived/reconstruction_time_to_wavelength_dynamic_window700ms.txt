Dynamic sliding-window reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 1.263663
Window width (ms): 700.000
Reconstruction start (ms): 348.740
Reconstruction end (ms): 843.612
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 0.618642 * t_ms + 201.291
Where t_ms is the compensated event timeline measured from the first sample.
