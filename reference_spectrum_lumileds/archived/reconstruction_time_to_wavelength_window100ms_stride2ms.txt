Sliding-window reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 0.100000
Window width (ms): 100.000
Window stride (ms): 2.000
Reconstruction start (ms): 232.000
Reconstruction end (ms): 508.000
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 1.109236 * t_ms + 159.693
Where t_ms is the compensated window-centre timeline measured from the earliest window.
