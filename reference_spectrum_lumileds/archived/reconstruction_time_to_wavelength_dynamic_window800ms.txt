Dynamic sliding-window reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 1.283655
Window width (ms): 800.000
Reconstruction start (ms): 348.539
Reconstruction end (ms): 841.213
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 0.621403 * t_ms + 200.453
Where t_ms is the compensated event timeline measured from the first sample.
