Dynamic sliding-window reconstruction vs. ground-truth alignment
Neg polarity scale (auto): 0.100000
Window width (ms): 100.000
Reconstruction start (ms): 338.896
Reconstruction end (ms): 602.768
Ground-truth start (nm): 417.036
Ground-truth end (nm): 723.185
Mapping formula (ms → nm):
  λ(t_ms) = 1.160218 * t_ms + 23.843
Where t_ms is the compensated event timeline measured from the first sample.
